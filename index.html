    <p>&emsp;This is a project that I did for the Graphics course offered at my school. This project's theme is Grand Theft Auto, my favorite video game. The game revolves around planning and engaging in heists and one of my favorite aspects of this game is the cars that you can buy and customize with money obtained from heists. Thus, I decided to add in a loop in which a car escapes after a bank heist and is chased by two police cars. This project includes various techniques that I learned throughout the semester, such as the dynamic environment map used for the reflection of the sculpture in the middle of the town or the various types of movements included in the town. I also included techniques that I discovered on my own, such as the drift smoke from the car which is in fact randomly placed sphere with varying color and opacity.
